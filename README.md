# Area Calculation Project with React Native

This project is a React Native application that allows you to calculate the area of a polygon made up of four geographic coordinates. Use modern technologies and libraries to create a mobile application that allows you to interact with the map and perform geographic area calculations.

## Project description

The objective of this project is to provide users with a tool that allows them to calculate the area of a geographical polygon from four coordinate points. Users can drag and drop markers on the map to define the four points, and the app will automatically calculate the polygon area.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

The project is developed using the following technologies and libraries:

- **React Native:** The mobile app development framework that uses JavaScript and React to create native apps.

- **Expo:** A set of tools and services for the development of mobile applications with React Native. Simplifies the development process and provides access to device capabilities such as location.

- **react-native-maps:** A React Native library that allows you to integrate interactive maps into your application.

- **expo-location:** An Expo library that provides access to device location, which is useful for setting bookmark locations and tracking current location.

- **Turf:** A JavaScript library used to perform geospatial calculations, in this case, to calculate the area of a geographic polygon from the coordinates provided by the markers.

## Installation and Use

Below are the steps to install and run the application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/m43c/coordinate-area
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
      cd coordinate-area
    ```
3. Install dependencies
    ```bash
      npm install
    ```
4. Start the application
    ```bash
      npx expo start
    ```
The app will run on a development server and you can view it on your mobile device or emulator.
